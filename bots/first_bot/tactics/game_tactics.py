TODO: here I will include when to go with each strat. with flags

for ECON: big_map, no castle is closer than 31 f.e.
            {build pilgrim with destiny to middle mine and save_for_church = True}
            {check if other castles are going for eco and mark it too.}

for RUSH: castle closer than 31, less than 7 mines of one resource
        {create phrophet, phrophet, crusader (maybe?) and give them the rush target}
        {check if other castles in rush so that chuch comes later}

for FAKE_RUSH:  no castle is closer than 35, but not further than 45 and 1 or 2 castles
                {creathe phrophet, pilgrim and save for church}
                {check if other castles are going for FAKE_RUSH and mark it too.}

GENERALLY create pilgrims for each of the mines you have assigned

Create pilgrims for karbonite first except if RUSH then go for fuel

if BEING_ATTACKED create counter phrophet: crusader, crusader: preacher, preacher: phrophets

if no pilgrims left to mine start creating a PHROPHETS for ARCHER LATTICE
